/**
 * Cosmius Hermes Service Worker
 *
 * The desktop window launcher and the active development workflow rely on
 * the latest static assets being served on every reload.  An older cache-
 * first service worker shipped earlier kept stale `sessions.js` / `boot.js`
 * files in browser caches even after the server received an update, which
 * made fixes look like they "did not deploy".
 *
 * To guarantee freshness in the packaged EXE flow we now:
 *   1. unregister this service worker on activation, and
 *   2. delete every cache it ever created.
 *
 * The script remains in place so previously registered installs can still
 * load it and self-terminate.  Once unregistered the browser falls back to
 * the network for every static asset, which is exactly what we want for a
 * desktop shell that always runs against a local HTTP server.
